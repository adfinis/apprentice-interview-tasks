# HTML, CSS, and Forms

Open the file [index.html](./index.html) with a web browser (Firefox, Chrome) and also
with a text editor (right-click, then open with editor).

## First Task

Modify the file in the editor, save it, and reload the page in the browser. What
happens? How does the change take effect?

## Second Task

Try to add a new input field to the form. What types of input fields are there? How are
they displayed?

## Third Task

Try to change the appearance of the form. Use CSS rules to do this.

Possible customizations:

  * Try to change the background of the page (image or color)
  * Change the borders of the input fields
  * Change the font of individual elements or of the entire page
